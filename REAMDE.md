# GB emulator 

This project is meant to learn the C programming langage and processor architecture. In no case this project is intended for commercial purposes as some ideas were taken from other projects within this field.

The GB internal architecture is very well documented so it is fairly simple to come up with an emulator which basically simulate the activity of the GB CPU (SHARP SM83).
